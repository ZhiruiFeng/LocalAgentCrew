## 2. Market Overview

### Pre-Market/Futures (as of 8:00 AM ET)

| Index | Futures Level | Change |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| S&P 500 | 6,931.01 | +0.14% |
| Dow Jones | 49,312.26 | +0.09% |
| Nasdaq 100 | 25,562.17 | +0.22% |

### Market Commentary

**US Session**: The S&P 500 rose to fresh all-time highs as investors broadened their exposure beyond mega-cap technology into small-caps and cyclicals. The December jobs report showed 50,000 payrolls added—below the 73,000 consensus—but the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%, suggesting a resilient but normalizing labor market. Markets interpret this as supportive of Fed rate cuts potentially as early as Spring 2026.

**European Session**: The STOXX 600 and STOXX 50 both advanced to fresh record highs, marking their first gains in three sessions. Germany's DAX led regional benchmarks with strong industrial exporter performance. Mining stocks surged on Rio Tinto/Glencore acquisition speculation (+7% for Glencore).

**Asian Session**: Markets traded mixed. Japan's Nikkei rallied 1.61% led by defense stocks amid geopolitical tensions. However, Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 1.2% as profit-taking emerged despite China's December CPI data showing +0.8% YoY inflation, signaling stabilizing consumer prices.

### Currency & Fixed Income

| Asset | Level | Change |
|-------|-------|--------|
| DXY (US Dollar Index) | 98.87 (intraday high: 99.06) | +0.03% |
| EUR/USD | ~1.0450 | -0.03% |
| USD/JPY | ~147.20 | +0.10% |
| 10-Year Treasury | 4.171% | -1 bps |
| 2-Year Treasury | 3.528% | +4 bps |
| 30-Year Treasury | 4.827% | -3 bps |

**Yield Curve Update**: The 2s10s spread has normalized to +64 bps (positive slope), with the 10-year at 4.171% vs 2-year at 3.528%. The curve is no longer inverted, though this normalization should be monitored as historically it precedes economic slowdowns. The 10-year yield initially spiked above 4.2% before retreating on the soft jobs data.

### Commodities

| Commodity | Price | Daily Change | Weekly Change |
|-----------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Gold | $4,470/oz | -0.3% | +3.0% |
| WTI Crude | $58.18 | +4.0% | +5.2% |
| Brent Crude | $62.59 | +1.8% | +4.2% |
| Silver | ~$29.50 | +0.5% | +2.8% |
| Natural Gas | ~$3.15 | -1.2% | +5.3% |

**Commodities Commentary**: Gold pulled back modestly from weekly highs but remains supported by central bank buying (China extended to 14th consecutive month) and geopolitical uncertainty. Crude oil surged on Iran tensions after President Trump warned of a "hard" response to the regime, combined with a larger-than-expected 3.8 million barrel draw in US inventories.

## 3. Market Internals

| Metric | Reading | Signal |
|--------|---------|--------|
| VIX | 15.06 | Low volatility regime |
| VIX Change | +1.07% (+0.16) | Slight uptick |
| Put/Call Ratio | ~0.72 | Bullish sentiment |
| NYSE Advance/Decline | ~2.1:1 | Healthy breadth |
| New 52-Week Highs | Elevated | Broad participation |
| New 52-Week Lows | Minimal | Risk-on environment |

**Volatility Commentary**: The VIX remains anchored below 20, indicating investor complacency. The modest uptick to 15.06 reflects some pre-positioning ahead of bank earnings and CPI data next week. A VIX below 15 would be considered extremely low; current levels suggest calm but not extreme complacency.

## 4. Sector Analysis

### Weekly Sector Performance

| Sector | Weekly Return | Trend |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| Technology | +2.8% | Leading |
| Materials | +2.5% | Outperforming |
| Healthcare | +2.2% | Strong |
| Financials | +2.0% | Neutral |
| Industrials | +1.8% | Neutral |
| Consumer Discretionary | +1.5% | Neutral |
| Real Estate | +1.2% | Lagging |
| Utilities | +0.8% | Defensive |
| Energy | +0.5% | Underperforming |
| Consumer Staples | +0.3% | Defensive |

### Sector Rotation Signals

**Cyclicals vs. Defensives**: Cyclicals are quietly outperforming defensives, suggesting investors are positioning for continued economic growth without abandoning caution entirely.

**Technology**: The "Phase 2" AI revolution narrative continues to drive leadership. ASML (+3.5%) and semiconductor names are rebounding after December consolidation. Intel surged on President Trump's public endorsement.

**Energy Divergence**: Despite oil price gains, the Energy sector remains structurally underweight at just 2.8% of S&P 500—near record lows. A supply surplus of 3.8-4.1 million bpd is projected for 2026, capping sector upside.

**Homebuilders**: Unexpected outperformance with D.R. Horton (+6%), PulteGroup (+7%), and Lennar (+8%) surging on Trump's mortgage bond purchase directive.

**Mining/Materials**: Glencore (+7%) led European materials higher on Rio Tinto acquisition speculation—a deal that would create the world's largest mining company.

## 5. Technical Signals

### Key Levels

| Index | Current | Support 1 | Support 2 | Resistance 1 | Resistance 2 |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|

| Dow | 49,266 | 49,000 | 48,500 | 49,500 | 50,000 |

1. **S&P 500**: Trading at all-time highs with strong momentum. The index has broken out above the December consolidation range. Key psychological level at 7,000 is now in sight.

2. **Russell 2000**: Small-caps hitting fresh records suggests healthy market breadth and risk appetite extending beyond mega-cap tech.

3. **Nasdaq 100**: Showing relative strength with the AI trade rotation continuing. Watch for a breakout above 25,600 for confirmation of new leg higher.

4. **Treasury Yields**: The 10-year yield pulling back from 4.2% resistance is equity-supportive. A sustained move above 4.25% would be a headwind.

### Notable Patterns

- **Breakout**: S&P 500 clearing December highs with volume confirmation
- **Strength**: Homebuilders showing bullish reversal patterns
- **Watch**: VIX coiling near 15—typically precedes directional move

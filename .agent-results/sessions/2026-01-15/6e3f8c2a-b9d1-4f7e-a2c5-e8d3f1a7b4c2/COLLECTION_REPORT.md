## Key Findings Archived

### Market Catalysts
1. TSMC blowout earnings (+35% profit growth, $52-56B capex for 2026)
2. Strong US economic data (jobless claims 198K, manufacturing beats)
3. Geopolitical de-escalation (Iran tensions ease, oil down 3%)

### Validation Findings
- Price data accuracy: 100% (within <0.1% for US/EU, <0.3% for Asia)
- Economic data accuracy: 100% (all same-day official sources)
- Data freshness: Acceptable (US current, Asia expected overnight delay)
- Overall validation: Partial Pass with Warnings

### Critical Review Findings
- Overall quality: Moderate
- Bias detected: Constructive (bullish) bias in interpretation
- Major risks potentially under-weighted: Tech concentration, valuation
- Factual accuracy: High (no material errors)
- Recommendations: Generally sound but caveat-dependent on assumptions

---

## Investment Committee Recommendations (Summarized)

### Immediate Actions
1. Maintain technology/semiconductor overweight - Validated by TSMC earnings
2. Reduce energy exposure - Geopolitical premium unwinding
3. Monitor VIX for hedging - Current low levels create cheap protection
4. Watch manufacturing data - Potential cyclical rotation signal

### Risk Adjustments
- Maintain disciplined position sizing (tech rally creates concentration)
- Keep cash for potential pullbacks
- Monitor China indicators weekly
- Track Fed speakers for rate cut signal changes

## 6. Risk Monitor

### Current Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Level | Status | Action |
|-------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Equity Valuations | ELEVATED | S&P 500 at 22x P/E | Monitor for mean reversion |
| Volatility | LOW | VIX at 15.06 | Complacency risk |
| Concentration | HIGH | 34.4% mega-cap tech | Diversification recommended |
| Inflation | MODERATE | 2.7% YoY, above 2% target | Watch Tuesday CPI |
| Fed Policy | TIGHT | 97% no Jan cut | Hawkish bias persists |
| Liquidity | STRONG | Ample market depth | Supportive |
| Geopolitical | MODERATE | Ongoing tensions | Background noise |

### Tail Risk Indicators

**Elevated:**
- Extended low-volatility regime often precedes sharp corrections
- Record equity valuations vulnerable to earnings disappointments
- Bank earnings week could trigger sector-wide moves (positive or negative)

**Manageable:**
- Rotation from mega-cap tech creates "air pockets" but is healthy for market breadth
- Consumer stress concentrated in lower-income segments, not yet systemic
- Fed remains data-dependent with flexibility to pivot if needed

### Scenario Analysis

**Base Case (60% probability):**
- Markets consolidate near all-time highs
- Rotation continues: small-caps and cyclicals outperform
- Bank earnings meet expectations; CPI continues moderating

**Bull Case (25% probability):**
- Bank earnings significantly beat on M&A revenue
- CPI surprises lower, reviving rate cut hopes
- S&P 500 pushes toward 7,200 by end of Q1

**Bear Case (15% probability):**
- CPI surprises higher, derailing rate cut timeline
- Bank earnings disappoint on credit concerns
- VIX spikes above 20; S&P 500 tests 6,700
